# Foundational Topics
DISCLAIMER: These notes are intended to supply information for beginning smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. The following   is a reduced and re-organized version of what exists at [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org)

For Perspectives, Whys, and Predictions read: [Short Articles by Chris Dixon on Web3](https://cdixon.mirror.xyz/TNOgrQGh_xUnBVO7wuYB-NMajrc3_0zN20-XznJRKlk)

- General Information
	- Blockchain
		- a public database that is updated and shared across many computers in a network
		- Components
			- block
				- a logical unit of stored data and state
			- chain (of blocks)
				- each block cryptographically references its parent
				- data in a block cannot change without the consensus of the entire network
			- nodes
				- machines running software that connect to a network
	- Wallet
		- an interface or application that lets you interact with your Ethereum account
		- facilitates interaction with cryptocurrency
- Ethereum
	- a blockchain with a shared virtual machine state
	- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
		- pool of computing power
		- this shared pool is finite, so Ethereum needs a mechanism to determine who gets to use it
		- requesting runtime on the EVM has gas costs 
			- costs depend on the resources required to do the computation 
			- some Math operations are more expensive than others
	- consensus mechanism
		- proof-of-stake
			- anyone who wants to add new blocks to the chain must stake at least 32 ETH into the deposit contract and run validator software
	- account
		- a keypair with access to currency that can interact with the EVM
		- Types of accounts
			- Externally-Owned accounts
				- users, companies, or any other entity with a private key
				- to create an account most libraries will generate you a random private key
			- Smart Contracts (a dapp's backend)
				- like a sort of vending machine: a script that, when called with certain parameters, performs some actions or computation if certain conditions are satisfied
				- any user can call the smart contract to execute its code for a fee paid to the network
				- Once smart contracts are deployed on the network you can't change them
	- Decentralized Applications (dapps)
		- an application built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface written in any language
			- frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as IPFS
			- FOSS tool for creating dapp frontends: https://oneclickdapp.com
		- has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network
	- Ether (ETH): the cryptocurrency of Ethereum
		- provides an economic incentive for participants
		- required to validate and propose blocks on Mainnet
		- Minting (creating)
			- minted as a reward for each block proposed and at every epoch checkpoint for other validator activity related to reaching consensus
		- Burning (destroying)
			- occurs in every transaction on Ethereum. When users pay for their transactions, a base gas fee, set by the network according to transactional demand, gets destroyed
		- Denominations
			- Wei ("way")
				- the smallest possible amount of ether
			- Gwei ("giga-way")
				- often used to describe gas costs on Ethereum 
				- (price of 1 Eth) x 10-9
	- Transactions
		- Types: 
			- Regular transactions: a transaction from one account to another.
			- Contract deployment transactions: a transaction without a 'to' address, where the data field is used for the contract code.
			- Execution of a contract: a transaction that interacts with a deployed smart contract. In this case, 'to' address is the smart contract address.
		- Lifecycle:
			- generates a transaction hash
			- transaction sent to the network and pooled with other transactions
			- a node selects and includes the transaction in a block
			- status moves to "justified" then "finalized"
	- Networks
		- Mainnet
			- the primary public Ethereum production blockchain
		- Testnet
			- used by protocol developers or smart contract developers to test both protocol upgrades as well as potential smart contracts in a production-like environment before deployment to Mainnet


# Ethereum Stack

- Layer 1: EVM
	- trufflesuite.com - a popular development framework
	- JavaScript API libraries
		- allows you to connect to Ethereum nodes
		- get wallet functionality
		- interact with smart contract functions
		- access to QoL utility functions 
- Layer 2: Smart Contracts
	- can be thought of as "Open APIs" 
	- Compiled prior to deployment to EVM
	- cannot get information about "real-world" events
		- use Oracles (intermediaries that can forward events / information to smart contracts from the Internet)
	- Languages
		- Solidity
			- Object-oriented, high-level language
			- Supports:
				- Inheritance (you can extend other contracts).
				- Libraries (you can create reusable code that you can call from different contracts â€“ like static functions in a static class in other object oriented programming languages).
				- Complex user-defined types.
			- Cheat Sheet
		- Vyper
			- Pythonic programming language
			- Deliberately has less features than Solidity with the aim of making contracts more secure and easier to audit
	- Anatomy
		- Data
			- variables assigned either to storage or memory
			- storage
				- stored permanently on the blockchain
			- memory
				- only stored for the lifetime of a contract function's execution
		- Functions
			- internal functions are only accessed from within the current contract
			- external functions are part of the contract interface, which means they can be called from other contracts and via transactions
	- There are many open source smart contract libraries available that provide reusable building blocks for your project that can save you from having to reinvent the wheel
- Layer 3: Ethereum Nodes
- Layer 4: Ethereum Client APIs
- Layer 5: End user Applications
